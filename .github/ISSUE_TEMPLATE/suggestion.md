Notice: Some of the best ideas and features we added were thanks to your suggestions. However, as an extremely small team we're focusing on stability and performance of our software first before adding new features. As such, we're currently very limited to taking in new features.

If you still believe your feature should be added, you're welcome to suggest it and answer those questions in your description: 

1) How it would benefit others? (Not just you, but 1,000s of others people using the same plugin.)

2) What would happen if we won't implement this feature? How's your server being affected?

3) If suggesting something new - Can the old system be modified/improved instead?

Thank you. Please remove this text and write your actual suggestion below.

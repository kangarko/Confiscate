# Confiscate
Confiscate silently clones hacked, duplicated items or those given by abusive staff for your review. It has been designed as an innovative approach to lower the frustration of server owners from:

* Abusive staff misusing commands like /give or simply creative mode.
* Duplication glitches.
* Hacked clients modifying items or enchants.
* X-rayers and other unwished ways to obtain high amount of rare materials quickly.
* Unbalanced server economy.

You are welcome to read the **[Confiscate Wikipedia](https://github.com/kangarko/Confiscate/wiki)**, where you will find tons of information about installing, configuring and using this plugin.

If you have any **questions or bugs to report**, try seeing if [those can be resolved quickly](https://github.com/kangarko/Confiscate/wiki/Common-Issues) by yourself.

# Confiscate
Confiscate is a premium grade Bukkit plugin that offers confiscating illegal items away from players. It has been designed as an innovative approach to lower the frustration of server owners from:

* Abusive staff misusing commands like /give or simply creative mode.
* Duplication glitches.
* Hacked clients modifying items or enchants.
* X-rayers and other unwished ways to obtain high amount of rare materials quickly.
* Unbalanced server economy.

Dave Thomas, founder of OTI, godfather of the Eclipse strategy:

<i>Clean code can be read, and enhanced by a developer other than its original author. It has unit and acceptance tests. It has meaningful names. It provides one way rather than many ways for doing one thing. It has minimal dependencies, which are explicitly defined, and provides a clear and minimal API. Code should be literate since depending on the language, not all necessary information can be expressed clearly in code alone.</i>
